<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engine brake market primarily includes two types: Compression Release Brakes and Exhaust Brakes. Compression Release Brakes work by venting compressed air from the cylinders during the engine's intake stroke, creating a braking effect. In contrast, Exhaust Brakes utilize the engine's exhaust flow, restricting it to generate resistance and slow down the vehicle. These braking systems are commonly used in heavy-duty trucks and vehicles, significantly enhancing control and safety during descents and reducing wear on traditional braking components.</p></p>
