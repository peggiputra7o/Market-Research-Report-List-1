<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Cone Penetrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mass DCP</li><li>Dual-Mass DCP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) market is primarily divided into two types: Single-Mass DCP and Dual-Mass DCP. Single-Mass DCPs feature a single weight that drops from a fixed height to penetrate the ground, making them suitable for quick site assessments and less rigorous applications. In contrast, Dual-Mass DCPs incorporate two different weights, providing enhanced versatility and allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of soil strength across varied depths. Both types serve critical roles in geotechnical and civil engineering projects.</p></p>
