<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Management Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) management products encompass devices designed to regulate the production and flow of CSF, crucial for treating conditions like hydrocephalus. CSF shunts are surgical implants that divert excess fluid from the brain to another part of the body, preventing pressure buildup. CSF drainage systems, on the other hand, enable controlled removal of CSF for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, often utilizing catheters and reservoirs. Both types are vital in maintaining intracranial pressure and ensuring patient safety.</p></p>
